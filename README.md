# Treadmill Data Analysis

## What We Did
- **Data Preparation:** Loaded and cleaned customer purchase records (demographics, fitness level, weekly mileage, model).  
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Examined distributions (age, income, education), model share, and running habits.  
- **Statistical Testing:** Calculated correlations (fitness level vs. mileage), and compared groups by income and education.  
- **Visualization:** Created bar charts for model popularity, histograms for demographics, and scatter plots for usage trends.

## Outcomes
- **KP281** is the top‐selling model (≈44% market share).  
- **Primary Buyers** are aged 20–40, representing 88% of purchases.  
- **Usage Correlation:** Fitness level correlates with weekly mileage (r ≈ 0.6).  
- **Premium Segment:** KP781 buyers average >\$85 k income and >20 years of education.

## Recommendations
- **Value Models (KP281, KP481):** Target 20–40 age group with income \$45 k–\$60 k via social and email campaigns.  
- **Premium Model (KP781):** Focus on high-income, highly educated customers through online professional networks and premium retail channels.
